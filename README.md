# CRUD Operation Using JSON File (Node.js)

## Project Description
This project is a simple **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) REST API** built using **Node.js** and **Express.js**.  
Instead of using a database, data is stored and managed in a **JSON file** using Node.js **fs (File System) module**.  
All APIs are tested using **Postman**.
